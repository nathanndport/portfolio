      <p>
        On the main parent page, the first page you will see when opening my site, it will mostly include my general information, including my career interests, as well as my hobbies and a little about me as a person so that whoever is reading is can get to know a little but more about who I am as a person. On this front page, I will also include links to my social media accounts, so the reader may do a little more research on me if necessary. On both the left as well as the right side of the page will be links that redirect the reader to the child pages of my website. On the left side link, it will take you to a page that will give you information on my education. On the right side of the page there will be a link that will take you to the other child page, and on that page, it will have all the information of work history.
